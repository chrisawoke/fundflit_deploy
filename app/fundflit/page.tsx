        <p>
          At Fundflit, our approach revolves around empowering users to create
          and engage in crowdfunding campaigns while leveraging the capabilities
          of Web5 technology. This means you are not just a participant; you are
          in control of your data, identity, and the future of your campaigns.

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold">Creating Campaigns with Web5</h2>
        <p>
          With Fundflit, users can create crowdfunding campaigns, and tap into
          the transformative potential of Web5. This technology ensures a
          decentralized and secure environment where you retain full control
          over your data. Your campaign, your rules.

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold">DID and Ethereum</h2>
        <p>
          Fundflit integrates Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) connected to
          Ethereum accounts. Your DID serves as a unique virtual identification,
          granting you unparalleled control over your data on the Web5 nodes
          associated with that identifier. This advanced identification method
          ensures a secure and private crowdfunding experience.

          Giving and Receiving with Confidence
        </h2>
        <p>
          Through the utilization of DIDs connected to Ethereum accounts, users
          gain the ability to seamlessly give or receive donations for projects.
          This process is not only efficient but also ensures the transparency
          and security that Web5 technology brings to the forefront.

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold">Understanding DIDs</h2>
        <p>
          A Decentralized Identifier is more than just a virtual ID; it's a key
          to unlocking control over your online presence. With your DID, you can
          access and manage the data on Web5 nodes linked to your identifier,
          ensuring a level of sovereignty over your personal information that
          traditional platforms often lack.

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold">Campaign Visibility</h2>
        <p>
          Your campaign on Fundflit is not open to the public by default. Only
          individuals possessing your DID or those with a direct link to your
          campaign can access it. Of course, you can decide to make it public,
          if you want. This heightened level of privacy ensures that your
          project remains visible only to those you choose to share it with,
          providing a secure and controlled crowdfunding environment.

      <section className="flex flex-col gap-6">
        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold">Data Ownership</h2>
        <p>
          In Web5, data ownership is a fundamental principle. With Fundflit, you
          are truly in possession of your data. This means that not only can
          other entities not access your campaign without the proper
          information, but even Fundflit itself is unable to intrude on your
          campaign details. Your data, your campaign, your control.
